I couldn't find any Riftbound counters I really liked online, so I decided to make one of my own for use with my friends. I intentionally avoided the use of any client-side libraries like React to keep the size of the app to a minimum.

This was an experiment to see how far I could get vibe-coding a simple JS app with Claude Code. I eventually picked up the reins near the end, but it was able to generate a lot of code itself.
